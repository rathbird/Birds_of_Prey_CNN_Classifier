    <h1>Owls - Death From Above</h1>
    <p>Owls come in all shapes and sizes. The largest northamerican owl is the Great Horned Owl which can weigh up to eight pounds
        with a six foot wingspan. Owls have very large, strong talons that is used to instantly snap the spine of its prey.
        Owls are also silent fliers, not only won't an animal hear it coming, it will be dead before it senses any danger at all. Although smaller
        than eagles and vultures, it does not shy away from poaching nests at night.
    </p>
    <p>They may be symbols of wisdom and intelligence, but as birds go, they are pretty low on the IQ scale, not nearly
        as bright as crows and  parrots, for example. They make up for it with swagger. The talons of a GHO have a grip strength of 500 psi; only
        the Golden Eagle can match that power, and they are twice their size. An owl's vision is remarkable, and They can see a rabbit from a mile away. 
        With an owl's eyes being the same size as ours, it's understandable why they aren't the wittiest bird, as most of their head space is taken up with their telescopic eyes. You will
        never catch an owl giving you the side-eye, they cannot move their eyes up or down, or side to side. To compensate, an owl can rotate its 
        head 270 degrees. Their ears are also wickedly adapted for hunting. In owls, the ears are not symmetric. This asymmetry allows the owl to 
        locate  prey, as they move their head to hear sounds, and when they move their head to hear the sound most clearly, they are 
        looking directly at their prey.
